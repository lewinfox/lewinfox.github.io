# Your data pipelines keep breaking. Let's fix that.

**Data Engineering Consultant | 5+ years turning chaos into clarity**

I help teams build reliable data systems that actually work — from broken spreadsheets to
enterprise-scale cloud platforms. No buzzwords, no complexity you don't need.

## What I do

### 🔧 **Data Pipeline Engineering**
Your daily reports failing? Data taking hours to update? I design robust ETL pipelines that run
reliably, using modern tools like **dbt**, **Airflow**, and **Snowflake**. From CSV chaos to
real-time analytics.

### ☁️ **Cloud & MLOps**
Stuck running models on laptops? I build production ML systems that scale — containerized models,
automated deployment, proper versioning. **AWS**, **Docker**, **MLflow**, **Terraform**.

### 📊 **Data Strategy & Migration**
Legacy systems holding you back? I've migrated terabytes from Oracle/Excel to modern cloud
warehouses, designed architectures serving 100+ users, and built systems processing millions of records daily.

### 🚀 **Full-Stack Data Development**
Need everything from dashboards to databases? I work across the entire data stack — **Python**,
**R**, **SQL**, **Terraform** — whatever gets your data working for you.
