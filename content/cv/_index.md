## Profile

I‚Äôm a senior data engineer specialising in MLOps and DevOps. I‚Äôve worked in both managerial and IC
roles and have a strong track record in product development. I‚Äôm proficient at gathering
requirements, collaborating with stakeholders, and managing expectations to deliver successful
projects. I value a supportive and collaborative working environment and am always keen to learn
from and teach others.

Outside of work I sail, ride motorbikes, scuba dive and paraglide. I relocated
from the UK to New Zealand in 2019 and live in Wellington with a collection of
house plants.
