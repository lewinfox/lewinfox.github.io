## Profile

I'm a senior data engineer specialising in MLOps and DevOps. I've worked in both managerial and IC
roles and have a strong track record in product development. I'm proficient at gathering
requirements, collaborating with stakeholders, and managing expectations to deliver successful
projects. I value a supportive and collaborative working environment and am always keen to learn
from and teach others.

## Open Source

Programming is a hobby as well as a job, and I'm passionate about open source software. I've
contributed to a number of open source projects and maintain the following:

- **[levitate](http://lewinfox.com/levitate)** - Fuzzy string comparison and similarity scoring.
- **[icecream](http://lewinfox.com/icecream)** - User-friendly print debugging in R.
- **[foodwebr](http://lewinfox.com/foodwebr)** - Draws function dependency graphs.
